This is a C++ program that prompts the user to enter a string of text, which is then sent to the active window of a CRM application (assuming the application is open and active) and also copied to the clipboard for use in another application. The program uses the Windows API to interact with the CRM application and clipboard. Specifically, the program uses the FindWindow function to find the handle of the active CRM window, and the SendMessage function to send the user's input as text to the CRM's input field. The program also uses the OpenClipboard, EmptyClipboard, GlobalAlloc, GlobalLock, strcpy_s, GlobalUnlock, SetClipboardData, and CloseClipboard functions to copy the user's input to the clipboard.
