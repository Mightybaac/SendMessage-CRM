This is a C++ program, This code will repeatedly prompt the user to enter text to be written to an open and active CRM application, and also copied to the clipboard. The user can enter 'q' to quit the program. The program will use a while loop to keep prompting the user for input until the user enters 'q'.

It is using the Windows API function FindWindow to find the window handle of the CRM application, assuming the CRM application is open and active.

If the CRM application is found, the program uses the SendMessage function to send the text entered by the user to the CRM's input field. If the CRM application is not found, the program displays an error message.

The program then uses the OpenClipboard function to open the clipboard and the EmptyClipboard function to empty it. Then it allocates a global memory block using the GlobalAlloc function, copies the input string to this block, and sets the clipboard data using the SetClipboardData function. Finally, it closes the clipboard using the CloseClipboard function.

It is also handling the case when it fails to open the clipboard, in that case it will display the error message "Failed to open clipboard"

This code will work on Windows platform only.
