This code is a Windows application in C++ programming language. The purpose of this code is to allow the user to input text, and then send that text to two windows: one with the name "CRM_Application", and the other with the name "Other_Application".

The code includes the headers "iostream", "string", and "Windows.h". The "Windows.h" header provides access to Windows operating system functions.

The program starts by defining two constant char pointers, CRM_APPLICATION and OTHER_APPLICATION, which are used to store the names of the windows to which the input text will be sent.

The function SendTextToWindow takes two arguments: a char pointer to the name of a window, and a string reference to the text to be sent to that window. The function first uses the FindWindow function to find a window with the specified name. If the window is found, the function uses the SendMessage function to send the input text to the window. If the window is not found, a message is printed to the console indicating that the window was not found.

The function CopyTextToClipboard takes a string reference to the input text, and copies it to the system clipboard. It first opens the system clipboard using the OpenClipboard function. If the clipboard is opened successfully, the function empties it using the EmptyClipboard function, allocates memory for the text using the GlobalAlloc function, locks the memory, copies the input text to the memory, and then sets the clipboard data to the memory using the SetClipboardData function. Finally, the clipboard is closed using the CloseClipboard function. If the clipboard is not opened successfully, an error message is printed to the console.

The main function of the program starts by declaring a string variable named "input" to store the user input. It also declares a boolean variable "keepRunning" that is set to true, which is used to control a while loop. The loop will repeat until the user enters "q".

Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to enter text. If the input is "q", the value of keepRunning is set to false, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If the input is not "q", the SendTextToWindow function is called to send the text to the "CRM_Application" window. Then, the CopyTextToClipboard function is called to copy the text to the system clipboard. Finally, the SendTextToWindow function is called to send the text to the "Other_Application" window.

The program returns 0 when the loop is finished, indicating a successful execution.
